# Using Galact

Once galact is installed, check for the help menu by using the following command
```bash
galact
```

This will bring up the help menu, if the app is installed properly. If the app isn't, then follow the instructions in [Installation](installation.md) again.

The app should look something like this:
```
~
‚ùØ galact
usage: galact [-h] {run,about} ...

positional arguments:
  {run,about}
    run        Run galact on cli
    about      Give info about Galact.

options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
```

After that, if you run `galact run` you enter a prompt with the actual bot running.

If you run `galact -h`, you get help info for the bot, such as commands and what they do.
