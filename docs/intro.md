# Installation

Without further ado, it is time to find out how to install this bot.

Installing on premises(on your desktop) should be very easy and painless. The
bot in itself is basically a script

cd into the bot folder like so
```bash
cd Bot
```

Then run the bot itself with the python interpreter:
On windows/mac
```bash
python Galact.py
```
On linux, though, generally you will have to use the python3 command instead of the "python" command.

So, on linux, running it will be as such:
```bash
python3 Galact.py
```
