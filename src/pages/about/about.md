# About Galact

[Galact](https://github.com/absozero/galact) will always be FOSS, and is liscenced under the MIT liscense at this moment. It uses the python interpreter to write to the command line, argparse for argument parsing on command line, and [Prompt_toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for styling the command line.

The documentation is hosted on github pages and uses [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus), which is also Open Source Software.
