            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started Galact, I knew that I had to make good documentation to help users
understand the project, and I knew that I could just make a wiki on the github wiki and

piece of software, and then I eventually landed on Docusaurus. It was like a CMS but with similar capabilities and less difficulties.</p><p>So I decided to set up a website for Galact. This is what you are seeing right now.</p>]]></content:encoded>
