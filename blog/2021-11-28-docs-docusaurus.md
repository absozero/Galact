When I started Galact, I knew that I had to make good documentation to help users 
understand the project, and I knew that I could just make a wiki on the github wiki and
be done and move on. But I also knew that I could do better and decided to make a website for the 
piece of software, and then I eventually landed on Docusaurus. It was like a CMS but with similar capabilities and less difficulties.

So I decided to set up a website for Galact. This is what you are seeing right now.
